Step #1--An Average Question

	Make a copy of the program avgmain.c in your
directory.  Write a function called myavg which takes four double
parameters and returns the average of them as a double, using
avgmain.c as the calling program.  The program will print the average
of four doubles assigned in avgmain.


Step #2--A Vaguely Useful Averaging Program

	Now you must modify the program avgmain.c so that it prompts
the user for four doubles as input, while still using the averaging
function you wrote in step 1.  You should check the resulting program
with various inputs to make sure it functions properly. 


Step #3--Scope it Out

	Make a copy of the program scope.c in your
directory.  Compile and run the program to see what it does.  Then
modify the main program so that it prints out the value of 'a' AFTER
the call to sub1.  Can you explain what happened?

Step #4--Totally Scoped

	Just to make things even more interesting, add an additional
function sub2 to the program, and call it from the function sub1.  The
function sub2 must again take 'a' as a parameter, but should modify it
differently than sub1 did (i.e. don't add 1 but maybe add 3, or
multiply by 6, or whatever you want to do) and print the value to the
screen.  You must also modify the function sub1 so that it prints out
the value of 'a' after the call to sub2.
